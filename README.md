# FIVER paper scripts - Tennant, et al. 2020
  * Classify_Ratio_Nucleus_Band_MEFs.groovy (QuPath)
  * Classify_Ratio_Nucleus_Band_MTECs.groovy (QuPath)
  * Combine_Project_Results.groovy (QuPath)
  * A Nikon JOBS workflow was also used in this paper - it can be found here: [Points on a Plate PFS Surface.bin](https://github.com/IGMM-ImagingFacility/JOBS/blob/master/Points%20on%20a%20Plate%20PFS%20Surface.bin)
  
  **Please Note:** Subsequent development of QuPath means these scripts may no longer be needed as some of the functionality they added is now accessible in the GUI. For more information visit [QuPath's website](qupath.github.io)
